# Dot-assessment

Your goal: To try and recreate the UI, UX and animations of this interface to the best of your abilities. We have consciously not provided you with any design specs such as font sizes, colors etc, because we believe that our frontend developers also need to have an eye for design details and intuition towards design, which is why you will be evaluated on how well can you recreate this design in code, using nothing but your visual judgement, design intuition and experience as a frontend developer.


It goes without saying, you are expected to build this in React.js. For the icons, feel free to use any icon library that you feel best matches the icons in the design, but for the UI components like buttons, switches etc, please DO NOT use any component library like material UI etc.
